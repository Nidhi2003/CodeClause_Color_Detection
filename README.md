# CodeClause_Color_Detection
# Introduction
The process of detecting the name of any color in an image is known as color detection.
This is an exceedingly simple task for humans, but it is not that simple for computers.
The eyes and brains of humans work together to convert light into color.
The signal is transmitted to the brain via light receptors in our eyes. The color is then recognized by our brain.

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name 
of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values.
Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

# color dataset
Red, green, and blue are the three primary colors that make up any color available. 
Each color value in a computer is defined as a number between 0 and 255.
A color can be represented in around 16.5 million different ways. We need to translate the values of each color to their names using our dataset.
Weâ€™ll be working with a dataset that contains RGB values along with their names.
The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.
